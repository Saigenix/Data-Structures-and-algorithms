# Notes for data structures and algorithms

### Data structures

* [Heap](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/heap-data-structure):
    1. Heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property, where any given node is
    2. always greater than its child node/s and the key of the root node is the largest among all other nodes. This property is also called max heap property
    3. always smaller than the child node/s and the key of the root node is the smallest among all other nodes. This property is also called min heap property.

### Algorithms







ðŸ”´!! Important !!ðŸ”´


Here's a comprehensive list of important data structures and algorithms that are often asked about in job interviews and placements:

Data Structures:
1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists

4. Queues
5. Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
6. Heaps (Binary Heaps, Priority Queues)
7. Graphs (Directed Graphs, Undirected Graphs, Weighted Graphs)
8. Hash Tables (HashMaps, HashSets)
9. Tries (Prefix Trees)
10. Disjoint Sets (Union-Find)

Algorithms:
1. Searching Algorithms:
   - Linear Search
   - Binary Search

It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the specific algorithms and data structures that may be relevant to a job interview or placement can vary depending on the company and the role you're applying for. It's a good idea to review these topics, understand their principles, and practice implementing them in your preferred programming language.
