     * runtime complexities:
     * 
     * O(1) = constant time:
     * anything has a runtime complexity of O(1) will take the same amount of 
     * time regardless of the data size.
     * ex:
     * .random access of an element in an array.
     * .inserting at the beginning of a linkedList.
     * 
     * 
     * O(log n) = logarithmic time:
     * anything has a runtime complexity of O(log n) will take increasingly less
     * time to complete. 
     * in other words, as the data size increases, the algorithm is going to be
     * more efficient.
     * ex:
     * .binary search.
     * 
     * 
     * O(n) = linear time:
     * as the data size increases, the time it takes to complete something
     * will increase proportionally, linearly.
     * ex:
     * .looping through elements in an array.
     * .searching through a linkedList.
     * 
     * 
     * O(n log n) = quasi-linear time:
     * for the most part, it is very similar to linear time unless we are 
     * working with a large data set.
     * anything using O(n log n) is going to slowdown when we work with larger 
     * data sets.
     * ex:
     * .quick-sort.
     * .merge-sort.
     * .heap-sort.
     * 
     * 
     * O(n^2) = quadratic time:
     * as the amount of data increases, anything has a runtime complexity of 
     * O(n^2) is going to take increasingly more time to complete.
     * ex:
     * .insertion sort.
     * .selection sort.
     * .bubble sort.
     * 
     * O(n): if n = 1000 then the number of steps is 1000.
     * O(n^2): if n = 1000 then the number of steps is 1000^2 which is 1000000.
     * 
     * 
     * O(n!) = factorial time:
     * as the amount of data increases, anything has a runtime complexity of 
     * O(n^2) is going to take increasingly more time to complete.
     * ex:
     * .Traveling Salesman Problem.
     * 
     * (some of these runtime complexities are efficient when working with a
     * smaller data set)
